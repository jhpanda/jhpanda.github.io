I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at Rockefeller University at <a href="https://zhaolab.rockefeller.edu">Dr. Li Zhao's lab </a>. My long term goal is to study how evolution give rise to novel protein structure, protein dynamics, and protein-protein interactions (PPI). This is essential to understand how evolutionary new add-ons shape the complex cellular machinary and how genetic innovation give rise to phenotypical novelty. In addition, this can help to understand how evolutionary new genes are related with health and diseases. To do this, I use a set of special genes, known as <i>de novo</i> genes, as these genes enable us to better track their origination and evolution compared to other genes. My work involves three directions. 
<small> 
  1. Develope comprehensive computational pipelines that integrate comparative genomics, multi-omics, and population genomics, to identify <i>de novo</i> genes in <i>Drosophila melangoaster</i> (fruit fly).  
  2. Apply large scale computational biophysics to study the <i>de novo</i> protein structures and their protein-protein interactions.   
  3. Combine molecular evolution and machine learning techniques to study how evolution give rise to novel protein structures and protein-protein interactions, and how evolution shape the complex cellular machinary.
